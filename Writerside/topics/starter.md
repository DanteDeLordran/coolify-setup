# Coolify setup

In this manual I am going to explain step by step how to set up and configure a Coolify instance.

Note: This guide is for non-sysadmins/linux experts. If you have already expertise in the area, maybe
Kubernetes or vanilla Traefik would make the job for you.

## Coolify minimum requirements

Coolify needs at least 2Gb RAM and 2vCPU (I'm writing this for Coolify version 4.0.0-beta.388)
